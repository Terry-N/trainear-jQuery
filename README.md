Trainear allows musicians to test their ear against a note-interval recognition challenge. Two piano notes are played simultaneously from any of the twelve chromatic intervals (and one octave above) for the musician to identify using the UI buttons. The average accuracy of their guess is calculated and displayed along with a hit / miss ratio. The correct answer for the round is displayed once the user has chosen an interval.
